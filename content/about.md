# Long story short
I was born as a **technology enthusiast** and fell in love with computers during my childhood.
I've had the chance to experience many beauties of computing from programming micro-controllers in assembly to developing React UIs, but I am attracted the most to **back-end**, data access and **integration**.
I always enjoy applying **simple solutions** to complex problems and love to **learn** anything related to technology while also **helping** younger colleagues and watching them grow.

# Short story long
My first experience with computers was my dad's **Atari 800 XL** when I was about 9 years.
The monitor was actually a small monochrome TV and I was a proud owner of 12 cassete tapes packed with games. 
My early steps with programming included typing in (char by char) some programmes (in **BASIC**) from printed computer magazines.  
I attended **electrical engineering** focused high-school with **specialisation on computers**.
That meant learning computers from the very bottom of "silicon primitives" like diodes and transistors, through different types of gates to ALUs, Control Units and finally CPUs.
We **learned assembly** language and programmed the **8051 micro-controller** (that beast had 256 bytes of RAM).
I had a chance to enjoy soldering some fancy projects like metal detectors or guitar effects, but we spent a lot of time learning **basics** of programming in **Pascal**.
We also learned about logical/physical addressing, IRQ, DMA, disks, RAMs and generally all about the PC architectures (caching, pipelining, etc.) at that time (XTs to early Intel Pentiums).
I have actually never really used most of this knowledge in my further carreer (except for making some guitar effects when I started playing guitra later or when playing with Raspberry Pi recently), but I never regreted learning all those things as I believe they formed great basis for understanding higher-level programming.  
After the high-school I was very lucky to get to (only 1 in 7 candidates made it) the newly founded **Faculty of Information Technology** (as part of Brno University of Technology).
We covered all of the traditional **Computer Science** areas like algorithms (complexities), data structures, formal languages or artifical intelligence along with assembly, computer architectures (both again :) ), signal processing, image recognition or computer graphics.
I've had some hard time getting through the different **discrete mathematics** areas, but in the hindsight I see this has set another solid basis for programming (we used MatLab a lot for these classes).
In the first year we used **Pascal** (mainly for algorithms and data structures), but then switched to **C**.
One of our first tasks in **C** was creating a **compiler** (as part of formal languages class).
That was quite brutal experience (anybody said pointer logic? :) ), but I think at that moment I turned from person interested in computers to an actual programmer.
I made my **Baechlor's thesis** focused on **color-space reduction methods** using **C**++ and **wxWidgets** (that framework is still alive).
I chose to continue with Master's focusing on 3D graphics and mutimedia.
This resulted in learning more about signal processing like **image reconginition** or **speech processing/synthetisation**, but the main part was learning all the areas behind 3D engines (projections, rendering, shading, textures, collision detection, etc.).
I have created many projects using C++ and **OpenGL** (my favourite one was water surface simulator), which improved my programming skills a lot.
My **Master's thesis** was named **'Realistic Simulation of Smoke'**, which was about applying various physical properties of gas like temperature, buyoancy, vorticity or pressure in 3D discrete space and rendering that using very simple (but effective) volume rendering method. I really enjoyed working on this thesis and it was fun to see the same algorithms making it into graphic cards and games later.
